# Telescope and Git integrations

This was created because I felt the default telescope git integrations were a little lacking. This is currently a personal project, but could theoreticaly be used in other setups.

## Requirements

- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) instaled in your system
- [plenary](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim)

## Install

### Packer

Add this to your Packer configuration:

`use { 'Jeansidharta/telescope-git' }`
